# Eclipse Prettier Plugin

## How it works
This plugin runs https://github.com/jhipster/prettier-java npm module in REPL that spits out formatted code and hooks into Eclipse formatter API/Extension to replace the code right before the save action.

## What works
This is currently only available for prettier JAVA, but if there is more interest it can be extended to other languages.
